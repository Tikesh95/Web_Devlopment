        "Ans. Padding -\n",
        "Padding is the space inside the element, between the content and the border. It pushes the content away from the edges of the element, creating a buffer within the element itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To give breathing room to the content within an element, enhancing readability and aesthetics.\n",
        "Example use: If you want text inside a button to not touch the edges, you can add padding. This is common in buttons, input fields, or cards to keep content visually separated from borders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Margin -\n",
        "Margin is the space outside the element, between the element’s border and neighboring elements. It controls the space around an element in relation to other elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To create separation between elements, helping to define their relative positioning on a page.\n",
        "Example use: If you have two buttons side-by-side and want to separate them, applying a margin to one or both will create space around them without affecting the padding or size of the elements themselves.\n",
        "When to Use Padding vs. Margin\n",
        "Use padding when you need to control the spacing inside an element.\n",
        "Use margin when you need to control the spacing outside an element, affecting how it relates to other elements.\n",
        "In practice, padding and margin are often used together to create a balanced and structured layout, as each serves a distinct purpose in spacing and layout control."

        "Does not start on a new line: It flows alongside other inline elements in the same line.\n",

        "Common Usage: Used for layout containers and larger structural elements like <div>, <h1> to <h6>, <p>, and <section>.\n",

        "An element with display: inline-block:\n",
        "\n",
        "Does not start on a new line: Similar to inline, it allows elements to sit next to each other.\n",
        "Respects width and height properties: Unlike inline, you can set the width and height explicitly.\n",
        "Common Usage: Used when you want elements to line up horizontally but still control their dimensions, like buttons or small card elements.\n",
        "Example: If you have multiple buttons that need precise width and height control and should align horizontally, display: inline-block allows this layout while respecting the specified dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to Use Each\n",
        "Use inline for text-like elements that flow naturally within lines of text.\n",

        "Use inline-block for horizontally-aligned elements where precise dimensions are needed, like buttons or navigation items.\n",

        "Purpose: Sets the maximum width that an element can have.\n",
        "Effect: Limits how wide an element can grow. When content or container size changes, the element will not expand beyond this width.\n",
        "Common Use Case: Often used for responsive images, content sections, and main containers to ensure they don’t become overly wide on larger screens.\n",
