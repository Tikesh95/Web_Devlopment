    "Ans. In HTML, forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. The two most common HTTP methods used for submitting form data are GET and POST. These methods determine how the form data is sent to the server and how the server handles that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GET Method\n",
    "The GET method appends form data to the URL specified in the form's action attribute. This data is sent as part of the URL query string, which appears after a ? in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of the GET Method:\n",
    "Data in the URL: The form data is visible in the browser’s address bar, appended to the URL as key-value pairs.\n",
    "Limited Data Size: Because the data is sent in the URL, there is a size limitation (typically around 2048 characters).\n",
    "Cached and Bookmarkable: The URL with the form data can be cached by the browser and can be bookmarked, which is useful for retrieving the same results later.\n",
    "Not Secure: Since data is visible in the URL, it is not suitable for sensitive information like passwords.\n",
    "Idempotent: Repeated requests with the same data will result in the same outcome without changing the state of the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. POST Method\n",
    "The POST method sends form data in the body of the HTTP request, rather than appending it to the URL. This method is more secure and flexible, making it suitable for a wide range of data submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of the POST Method:\n",
    "Data in the Body: The form data is included in the request body, not in the URL, making it invisible in the browser’s address bar.\n",
    "No Data Size Limitation: There is no practical limit on the size of the form data that can be sent, making it suitable for sending large amounts of data.\n",
    "More Secure: Although not inherently secure (as it can still be intercepted), the data is not exposed in the URL, making it safer for sensitive information when combined with HTTPS.\n",
    "Not Idempotent: Multiple submissions of the same form data can result in different outcomes, such as creating multiple records in a database.\n",
    "Used for Sensitive Data: POST is commonly used for forms that involve sensitive or confidential information, such as login credentials or payment information.\n"
